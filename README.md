# Keyword-Extraction
This project implements keyword extraction using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) technique in Python. It preprocesses raw text, converts it into TF-IDF vectors, and extracts the highest-scoring terms as keywords. Ideal for text analysis, search optimization, and information retrieval tasks.
